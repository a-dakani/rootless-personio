# "Rootless" Personio API client

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/jilleJr/rootless-personio)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/jilleJr/rootless-personio)
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/jilleJr/rootless-personio/pkg/personio.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jilleJr/rootless-personio/pkg/personio)

Accessing [Personio's API](https://developer.personio.de/docs)
requires API credentials [which does not scope to the employee level](https://developer.personio.de/discuss/634e4b08a3f8d80051c52cfe),
meaning you can only get official API access as an admin user,
where you get access to the sensitive information of all the employees in your
company.

Instead, this package uses a different API: the same API as your web browser.

This is done by pretending to be a browser and logging in normally using
email and password.
